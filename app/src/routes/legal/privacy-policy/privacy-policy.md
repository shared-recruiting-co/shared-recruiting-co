## Who is the data controller or processor?

Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of information. When you use our our product as an employee of an organization which subscribes to us, your organization (i.e., our customer) is the data controller, and we are a data processor acting on its behalf. If you use our product as an individual, we will act as a processor on your behalf.

We use personal data for the following purposes: to enable your use of the features we provide through our Services; to communicate with you; to diagnose technical problems with our Services. We may also use non-identifying and aggregated data to help improve our Services and our website.

## What happens to my data when I cancel or ask my account to be deleted?

You can request closure of your account directly from the our product. Please be aware that deletion of your Account will result in you permanently losing access to your account and the data in the account. After deletion of your account, certain information associated with your account may remain on SRC’s servers in an aggregated form that does not identify you. Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal information — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations until it’s no longer needed.

## What permissions does SRC need in order for our service to work?

We need certain permissions in order for our Service to function. We use the following Google Mail scopes 

#### https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify

We use the Gmail modify scope to read new and historic emails, so that we can identify the emails as a recruiting email or not. For incoming recruiting emails, we use the Gmail modify scope to respond to the Sender on your behalf.

#### https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels

SRC uses the _@SRC_ label and sublabels to manage your recruiting inbound. We use the Gmail labels scope to create, read, and modify SRC managed labels.

Our processing of any information received from Google APIs adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the “Limited Use” requirements contained in that policy.
