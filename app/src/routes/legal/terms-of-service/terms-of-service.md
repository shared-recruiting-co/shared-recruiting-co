BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT.

### 2. Scope
The Service is a tool to help you (as a "**Recipient**") manage inbound job opportunities emails from ("**Senders**"). By registering to use the Service, the Service creates a new folder in the Recipient’s inbox and moves emails messages identified as job opportunities from Senders from the Recipient’s general inbox to this folder. The Service will also send an automated response, on Recipient’s behalf from Recipient’s email, to the Sender. The automated message stops automated email campaigns from continuing and lets the Sender know the Recipient is a member of the SRC.

For clarity, this Agreement applies to both Recipients and Senders.

### 16. Dispute Resolution
_Let's Try To Work It Out_. Ideally, if you have any concerns or complaints against SRC, we would like to resolve the issue without resorting to formal court or arbitration proceedings. Therefore, before filing a claim against SRC, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us as set forth in Section 15 above. SRC will attempt to resolve the dispute informally (and will contact you via email). If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of submission, you may bring a formal proceeding.

_Arbitration_. Any disputes that are not settled informally as contemplated above shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures (“Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The Rules will be AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules if available. Arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator selected in accordance with the Rules. In the event any telephonic or other streamlined procedures are available – they will be used. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in any court.  The arbitration proceeding shall take place in San Francisco, California using the English language. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring claims for equitable or injunctive relief before a court (see the “_Going to Court_” section below) at any time. _Evidence._ If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents we and you submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Rules. Subject to the Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

_Fees._ The parties’ will each bear their own costs and expenses associated with arbitration – and responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. _No Class Actions_. You may only resolve disputes with SRC on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. _Modifications_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to the foregoing arbitration terms or conditions (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link) in the future, such amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against SRC prior to the effective date of the amendment. In addition, you shall have the reject any such amendment by notifying SRC in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you are first notified of the amendment (according to the procedures set forth above in this Section 16). In the event you so reject an amendment, the amendment will not apply to you – but this Section 16 will otherwise remain in fully force and effect (according to the pre-amendment version you had already agreed to).

_Going to Court_. Subject to the arbitration provision above, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be in the state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California. You hereby submit to such jurisdiction and venue.

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THIS SECTION 16 WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED OR OTHERWISE.

### 17. General
The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with SRC’s prior written consent. SRC may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as if made within California between two residents thereof. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.
