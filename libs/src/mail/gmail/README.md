# gmail

`gmail` is a wrapper Go library for working with the [Google gmail API](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/gmail/v1). 

It is in active development and makes no guarantees about API stability. The long-term goal is to create a standard `mail` interface we can use across all email clients, like Gmail and Outlook.
