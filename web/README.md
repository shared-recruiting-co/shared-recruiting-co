# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

The `web` directory is for managing the web application of the SRC (Shared Recruiting Co.) platform. It includes configuration files for ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS, TypeScript, and Vite. It also contains the `src` directory for managing the source code, the `static` directory for storing static assets, the `supabase` directory for managing the Supabase project configuration, and the `tests` directory for storing Playwright tests. Additionally, it includes a `README.md` file with instructions for creating, developing, and building a Svelte project.

### Files
#### .env.example
This file contains an example environment file with placeholders for local values. It includes variables for Vercel, Turbo, Nx Daemon, Google, Supabase, and Gmail Pub/Sub topics.

#### .eslintignore
This file contains a list of files and directories that should be ignored by ESLint, a tool used for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. The ignored files include common directories like `node_modules` and `build`, as well as specific files like `.env` and `package-lock.json`.

#### .eslintrc.cjs
This file is the ESLint configuration file for the web directory. It sets up the ESLint rules and plugins to be used for linting TypeScript and Svelte files, while ignoring CommonJS files. It also specifies the environment in which the code will run.

#### .gitignore
This file contains a list of files and directories that should be ignored by Git when committing changes to the repository. It includes common files such as `.DS_Store` and directories such as `node_modules` and `build`. It also includes specific files such as `.env` and `.vercel`.

#### .npmrc
This file sets the `engine-strict` flag to true for npm, which enforces strict version checking for dependencies.

#### .prettierignore
This file contains a list of files and directories to be ignored by the Prettier code formatter, including node_modules, build, and various lock files for package managers.

#### .prettierrc
This file configures Prettier, a code formatter, for the web directory. It specifies options such as using tabs instead of spaces, using single quotes instead of double quotes, and not including trailing commas. It also includes plugins for formatting Svelte and Tailwind CSS code.

#### package-lock.json
This file (`web/package-lock.json`) contains a manifest of all the dependencies installed in the `web` directory of the codebase, including their versions, sub-dependencies, and integrity hashes. It is automatically generated by npm to ensure consistent installations across different machines and environments.

#### package.json
This file is the `package.json` file for the web directory. It includes the project's name, version, private status, scripts for development, testing, and linting, as well as dependencies and devDependencies.

#### playwright.config.ts
This file exports a configuration object for Playwright tests. It sets up a web server command to build and preview the application on port 4173.

#### postcss.config.cjs
This file contains the PostCSS configuration for the web directory. It specifies the plugins to be used, including Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.

#### svelte.config.js
This file `svelte.config.js` exports a Svelte configuration object that defines the Svelte preprocessor and the adapter for SvelteKit. The preprocessor is set to use PostCSS, and the adapter is set to `@sveltejs/adapter-auto`.

#### tailwind.config.cjs
This file `tailwind.config.cjs` is the configuration file for the Tailwind CSS framework used in the SRC web application. It sets the dark mode to 'class', specifies the content to be styled, and extends the default theme to include custom font families and maximum width values. It also includes plugins for forms and typography.

#### tsconfig.json
This file is the TypeScript configuration file for the web directory. It extends the configuration from the .svelte-kit directory and sets various compiler options such as allowing JavaScript files, enforcing strict typing, and enabling source maps. Path aliases are handled by the SvelteKit configuration file.

#### vite.config.ts
This file contains the configuration for Vite, a build tool for web applications. It imports the SvelteKit plugin and exports a user configuration object that includes the SvelteKit plugin.

### Directories
#### src
The `src` directory is for managing the source code of the SRC web application. It includes files for CSS styling, TypeScript declaration, HTML templates, and server-side logic. The `lib` directory exports utility functions and Svelte components, while the `routes` directory manages the routes and pages of the platform.

#### static
The `static` directory is for storing static assets used in the SRC (Shared Recruiting Co.) website, including the SRC logo, Google and Gmail logos, and the favicon. It also contains the `robots.txt` file that instructs web robots or crawlers on which pages or files to exclude from indexing. Additionally, the `docs` directory is for storing visual assets used in the documentation of the SRC platform.

#### supabase
The `supabase` directory is for managing the Supabase project configuration, database schema changes, and testing. It includes a `.gitignore` file, `config.toml` for project settings, an `extensions.sql` file for creating a SQL extension, a `migrations` directory for managing database schema changes, and a `tests` directory for testing the database functionality.

#### tests
The `tests` directory is for storing Playwright tests that ensure the functionality of the SRC platform. The `web/tests/test.ts` file specifically contains a test that checks if the index page has an expected h1 element with the text "Welcome to SvelteKit".
