The `images` directory is for storing visual assets used in the documentation of the SRC (Shared Recruiting Co.) platform. These assets include screenshots, diagrams, and other images that help illustrate the functionality and features of the platform. The directory may contain subdirectories to organize images by topic or section of the documentation.
