The `marketing` directory is for Svelte components that render marketing-related content, such as FAQs, features, and a step-by-step guide on how the Shared Recruiting Co. platform works.

### Files
#### FAQs.svelte
This file contains a Svelte component that renders a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) with collapsible answers in the marketing section of the codebase. It takes in an array of FAQ objects and toggles the visibility of each answer when the corresponding question is clicked.

#### Features.svelte
This file exports a Svelte component called `Features` that displays a section with a title, description, and a list of features. The features are passed in as an array of objects with an icon, title, and description. The component uses flexbox to display the features in a responsive grid.

#### HowItWorks.svelte
This file contains the `HowItWorks` component, which displays the steps involved in the Shared Recruiting Co. (SRC) process. The component takes in an array of `steps`, each of which has a `title` and `description`, and displays them in a numbered list with corresponding icons.
