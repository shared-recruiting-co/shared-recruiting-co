	<p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
		At SRC, members trust us with some of their most sensitive information, their emails and their
		job status. Sadly, we've seen firsthand what happens when companies abuse this. We've seen
		employers use LinkedIn to find out which employees are looking for new roles. We've seen
		backlash against recruiting companies for making candidate job profiles public without their
		consent. SRC does not and will never store your emails within our database. We use native email
		functionality, like labels and folders, to securely manage your emails from within your inbox.
	</p>
	<p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
		And with SRC's two-way opt-in communication, your job status is confidential. Companies cannot
		see if you are looking for a new role until you choose to start the interview process.
	</p>
	<p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
		By open sourcing SRC, we are making more then a promise of privacy. All the ways we use and
		protect your data is transparent and auditable.

	<p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
		The <a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/casa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
			>Cloud Application Security Assessment (CASA)
		</a>is built upon the industry-recognized standards of the OWASP's Application Security
		Verification Standard (ASVS) to provide a consistent set of requirements to harden security for
		any application. CASA is required for any application accessing user email data via OAuth. SRC
		is Tier-2 CASA compliant. SRC's CASA compliance has been verified by an independent lab partner
		as part of the Google OAuth approval process.

	<p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
		SRC is commited to adhering to the best security practices. We are actively working towards

	<h2 class="mb-4 text-4xl">Open Source</h2>

		We chose to open source SRC because we believe open source software builds trust, community, and
		more secure products. The current recruiting ecosystem is shrouded in secrecy. Candidates don't
		know how recruiters get access to their personal email addresses or how their personal
		information is stored and used. This lackadaisical approach to candidate privacy has been
		normalized over the past few years, but SRC takes a radically different approach. We want both
		candidates and companies to know exactly how and why we use, store, and process their data. Open
		sourcing SRC not only allows us to be transparent, but it also keeps SRC accountable. Any change
		to how SRC deals with your data is open to public scrutiny.
	</p>
	<p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
		Public scrutiny is also essential to security. To quote <a

		>, "We believe Linus's law of 'given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow' applies to security
		issues.'". Open source software allows exploits to be identified as early as possible and
		patched just as fast. In the long run, we believe open sourcing SRC will allow us to build the
		most secure and trusted recruiting platform.
