The `privacy-policy` directory is for storing the Privacy Policy page and its content. It includes a Svelte component that renders the page and a Markdown file that contains the privacy policy for SRC's candidate-centric recruiting platform.

### Files
#### +page.svelte
This file is a Svelte component that renders the Privacy Policy page. It imports the `Markdoc` library to parse and render the content of the `privacy-policy.md` file. The rendered content is displayed in an HTML article element.

#### privacy-policy.md
This file contains the privacy policy for SRC's candidate-centric recruiting platform, outlining the types of personal data collected, how it is used and shared, and the rights users have to access and control their information. It also includes information on deleting accounts, the use of cookies and tracking technologies, and contact information for privacy-related concerns.
