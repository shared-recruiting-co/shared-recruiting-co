The `.github` directory is for managing various aspects of the SRC codebase on GitHub. It includes a `FUNDING.yml` file for listing supported funding platforms, a `dependabot.yml` file for configuring Dependabot, a pull request template, and directories for issue templates and workflows. These files and directories help streamline contributions, automate tasks, and ensure code quality.

### Files
#### FUNDING.yml
This file, `.github/FUNDING.yml`, contains a list of supported funding model platforms for the project, including GitHub, Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Tidelift, Community Bridge, Liberapay, IssueHunt, Otechie, LFX Crowdfunding, and custom sponsorship URLs. The file allows users to easily contribute to the project through their preferred platform.

#### dependabot.yml
This file is the configuration file for Dependabot, a tool used to keep dependencies up to date. It specifies which package ecosystems to update, where the package manifests are located, and the update schedule.

#### pull_request_template.md

### Directories
#### ISSUE_TEMPLATE
The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory is for providing templates for bug reports and feature requests. The `bug_report.md` file includes sections for describing the bug, steps to reproduce it, expected behavior, screenshots, and additional context. The `feature_request.md` file contains prompts for describing the problem, proposing a solution, and providing any alternative solutions or additional context.

#### workflows
The `workflows` directory is for storing GitHub Actions workflows that automate various tasks such as auto-assigning pull requests, running CI tests, analyzing code with CodeQL, and deploying migrations to production. These workflows are triggered on specific events and can be customized to fit the needs of the SRC codebase.
